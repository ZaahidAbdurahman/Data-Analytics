THE ANALYTICS PROCESS

 Analysts working with data move through a series of different steps as they seek to gain business value from their organization's data. 

-Data Acquisition

-Cleaning and Manipulation

-Analysis

-Visualization

-Reporting and Communication

While we describe the steps of the analytics process as a series of sequential actions.
It is more accurate to think of them as a set of interrelated actions that may be revisited frequently while working with a dataset.

Analytics Techniques:

 Analysts use a variety of techniques to draw conclusions from the data at their disposal.

 Descriptive Analytics
-Descriptive analytics focuses on exploring and interpreting historical data to provide a comprehensive understanding of past events and trends. 

 Predictive Analytics
-Predictive analytics is particularly valuable for businesses when they want to stay ahead of future trends, behaviors, and outcomes.

Prescriptive Analytics
-Prescriptive analytics is most valuable for businesses when they are seeking to predict future outcomes and determine the best course of action to achieve specific objectives. 

DATA GOVERNANCE
-Data governance programs ensure that the organization has high-quality data and is able to effectively control that data.

ANALYTICS TOOLS
-Software helps analysts work through each one of the phases of the analytics process. 

-These tools automate much of the heavy lifting of data analysis, improving the analyst's ability to acquire, clean, manipulate, visualize, and analyze data.
